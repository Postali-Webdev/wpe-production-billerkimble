    <h2>BILLER & KIMBLE: <span>HOW WE’RE PAID</span></h2>
    <p>If you are worried about being able to afford our services, don’t be. For almost all of our clients—especially the employees we usually represent—we only get paid when we recover money for them. This “contingent fee” arrangement lets us represent individuals who could not ordinarily afford top-notch lawyers. It also puts our financial interests in line with your own.</p>
    <p>It is also important to know that most of the laws we work with, including the Fair Labor Standards Act, allow us to recover our fees and costs from your employer. Because of this, we can take on both the big and small cases.</p>
